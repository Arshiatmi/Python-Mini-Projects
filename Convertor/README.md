# Convertor

You Can Make Any Python Program With Your Custom Words ! Change Any Text You Want And Pass It To Convertor File After That
You Can Run output.py File To See Your output. ( Or You Can Play Like `python convertor.py code.scr --play` To Run After Convert.)

As You Might See This Is Reeeeally Bad Code And Wont Run Right At All :/

So Just See The Code And Dont Use It XD
